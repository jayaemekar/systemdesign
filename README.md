## Learn how to design large-scale systems
Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic. There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on system design principles.

This repo is an organized collection of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

**The process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system to meet specified criteria is referred to as system design.**

When constructing a huge system, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

  1. What are the many architectural components that can be utilized?
  2. What is the relationship between these components?
  3. What are the best tradeoffs to make in order to get the most out of these components?

The issue of system design is wide. There are numerous materials on system design principles dispersed over the internet. Many tech organizations require system design as part of the technical interview process in addition to coding interviews.

Building and engineering systems demand a systematic approach to system design. A smart system design considers everything in an infrastructure, from hardware and software to data and how it's kept.
