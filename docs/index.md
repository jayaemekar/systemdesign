# What is System Design?

The process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system to meet specified criteria is referred to as system design.

When constructing a huge system, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

  1. What are the many architectural components that can be utilized?
  2. What is the relationship between these components?
  3. What are the best tradeoffs to make in order to get the most out of these components?

The issue of system design is wide. There are numerous materials on system design principles dispersed over the internet. Many tech organizations require system design as part of the technical interview process in addition to coding interviews.

Building and engineering systems demand a systematic approach to system design. A smart system design considers everything in an infrastructure, from hardware and software to data and how it's kept.
