# SQL vs. NoSQL

There are two sorts of database solutions in the world: SQL and NoSQL (or relational databases and non-relational databases). The manner they were designed, the type of information they hold, and the storage mechanism they use are all different.

Relational databases, like phone books that record phone numbers and addresses, are structured and have predetermined schemas. Non-relational databases, like file folders, are unstructured, distributed, and feature a dynamic schema that stores everything from a person's address and phone number to their Facebook "likes" and online shopping preferences.

## SQL

Data is stored in rows and columns in relational databases. Each row holds all of the data for a single entity, whereas each column has all of the individual data points. MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, SQLite, Postgres, and MariaDB are some of the most popular relational databases.

## NoSQL
The most prevalent forms of NoSQL are as follows:

**Key-Value Stores:** Data is kept as a key-value pair array. A 'key' is a term for an attribute that is associated to a 'value.' Redis, Voldemort, and Dynamo are examples of well-known key-value stores.

**Document Databases:** Data is kept in documents (rather than rows and columns in a table) in these databases, and these documents are grouped together in collections. The structure of any document can be completely different. CouchDB and MongoDB are two document databases.

**Wide-Column Databases:** Column families, rather than 'tables,' are containers for rows in columnar databases. We don't need to know all the columns up front, and each row doesn't have to have the same number of columns as a relational database. Columnar databases, such as Cassandra and HBase, are ideally suited for analyzing massive datasets.

**Graph Databases:** These databases are used to hold information that can best be represented as a graph. Nodes (entities), attributes (information about the entities), and lines are used to store data in graph topologies (connections between the entities). Neo4J and Infinite Graph are two examples of graph databases.

## Differences in SQL vs NoSQL on a high level

**Storage:** SQL saves data in tables, with each row representing an entity and each column representing a data point about that entity; for example, if we're keeping a car entity in a table, distinct columns might be 'Color, Make, Model,' and so on.

The data storage models used by NoSQL databases vary. Key-value, document, graph, and columnar are the most common types. Below, we'll compare and contrast these two databases.

**Schema:** Each record in SQL must adhere to a fixed schema, which means that the columns must be determined and chosen prior to data entry, and each row must have data for each field. Later, the schema can be changed, but it will require updating the entire database and going offline.

Schemas in NoSQL are dynamic. Columns can be added at any time, and each 'row' (or equivalent) does not need to include data for each 'column.'

**Querying:** SQL (structured query language) is a powerful language for defining and manipulating data in SQL databases. Queries in a NoSQL database are focused on a set of documents. UnQL is another name for it (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax for using UnQL varies depending on the database.

**Scalability:** In most cases, SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning that they may be scaled up by increasing the hardware's horsepower (memory, CPU, etc.), which can be quite costly. A relational database can be scaled across numerous servers, but it is a difficult and time-consuming operation.

NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable, which means we can quickly add more servers to our NoSQL database infrastructure to manage a large amount of traffic. NoSQL databases may be hosted on any cheap commodity hardware or cloud instances, making it much more cost-effective than vertical scaling. Many NoSQL technologies also automatically spread data across servers.

**Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) Compliance:** ACID compliance is seen in the vast majority of relational databases. So, when it comes to data consistency and transaction security, SQL databases are still the preferable option.

For performance and scalability, most NoSQL solutions forgo ACID compliance.

## SQL vs. NoSQL: Which is Better?

There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to database technology. As a result, many firms use both relational and non-relational databases for various purposes. Despite the fact that NoSQL databases are becoming more popular due to their speed and scalability, there are still occasions where a highly organized SQL database may outperform; the proper technology depends on the use case.

### Benefits of Using a SQL Database

Here are some of the benefits of using a SQL database:

1. We must ensure that ACID compliance is met. By specifying exactly how transactions interact with the database, ACID compliance lowers anomalies and maintains the integrity of your database. In general, NoSQL databases forego ACID compliance in favor of scalability and processing speed, yet an ACID-compliant database remains the preferred solution for many e-commerce and financial applications.
2. Your data is well-organized and stable. There may be no reason to employ a system built to support a range of data kinds and large traffic volume if your firm is not seeing enormous expansion that would necessitate more servers and if you're simply working with data that is consistent.

### Benefits of Using a NoSQL Database

When all of our application's other components are running smoothly, NoSQL databases keep data from becoming a bottleneck. Big data is helping NoSQL databases achieve great success, owing to the fact that it processes data differently than traditional relational databases. MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, and HBase are some examples of NoSQL databases.

1. Managing enormous amounts of data with little to no organization. A NoSQL database has no restrictions on the types of data that can be stored together and allows us to add new types as our needs evolve. You can store data in one place with document-based databases without needing to describe what "kind" of data you're storing in advance.
2. Using cloud computing and storage to its full potential. Cloud storage is a great way to save money, but it requires data to be easily transferred over several servers in order to scale up. Using commodity (cheap, smaller) hardware on-site or in the cloud eliminates the need for additional software, and NoSQL databases like Cassandra are built to scale across numerous data centers without causing a lot of headaches out of the box.
3. Rapid progress. Because NoSQL does not require any prior preparation, it is ideal for quick development. A relational database will slow you down if you're working on quick iterations of your system that require frequent adjustments to the data structure with little downtime between versions.
