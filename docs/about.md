This document is dedicated to system design interview preparation.

A systematic approach to system design is referred to as systems design. It may take a bottom-up or top-down approach, but the process is systematic in that it considers all related variables of the system that needs to be createdâ€”from the architecture to the required hardware and software, all the way down to the data and how it travels and transforms throughout its journey through the system. 

The terms systems design, systems analysis, systems engineering, and systems architecture are all used interchangeably.

Engineers were striving to address complicated control and communications difficulties just before World War II when the systems design method first surfaced. They needed to be able to formalize their work and use suitable methodologies, especially in new domains like information theory, operations research, and computer science in general.
